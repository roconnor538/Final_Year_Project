# Everything Begins With An Idea

Hi, Welcome to my blog. I will be describing the week to week progress I have made to create my final year project. The first of these blogs will be just a brief introductory of how the idea came about.

I was hoping to get a project idea or a specific project from the company where my intra placement took place. The company had a few different projects they would like me do but none of the ideas I felt were going to be deemed large or difficult enough to base my whole year around. The main idea they wanted was based around a database. The database was going to be served as an archive for all the tickets the company ever took on. They specifically wanted their customers to be able to check for any tickets they had created.  The starting block for this project was for to me place all these tickets in a database. Alongside this database I had to manufacture a search bar for the customer to enter their queries. To retrieve the information they wanted some SQL commands had to be written to search through the database and once found it was simply returned to the user. The reason I decided this concept was not going to be possible to base the year around was the sheer size if it. Although the database was going to be big finding the information however was just going to be a few simple SQL queries. At this point I needed to rethink my idea.

The idea I went with was stemmed by my passion for video games. I wanted to understand the work that went into creating these games even if the general concept for the game was basic. I felt once I knew the work involved that it would make me appreciate video gaming even more. In my last few weeks of intra placement I began to think about different possible designs. Once finished my placement I began to plan out the game with different drawings and concepts. I now had solid idea all I needed now was a supervisor. I emailed and met face to face with a few different lecturers but I failed successfully convince them to be my supervisor. The lack of knowledge on the subject and the failure to be able to test the finished component was the response I was getting. They did however recommend possible candidates the project would suit.
